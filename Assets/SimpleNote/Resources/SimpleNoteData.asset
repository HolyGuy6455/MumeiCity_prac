    note: "Owls get stuck on buildings and natural structures like rocks and crops\r\nOwls
      cannot complete a task. In my instance my harvester owl was stuck trying to
      harvest a cabbage crop.\r\nMumei can walk on water if you walk along the invisible
      barriers that limit the world.\r\nThe House is called a tent in the Houses
      own menu\r\nTrying to remove a structure with the Hammer tool (in my case a
      Sanctum) causes the structure to break infinitely and spew out materials without
      ending.\r\nSometimes Mumei starts to swim while it appears she is still standing
      on land.\r\nWhen placing buildings, the material counters do not update to
      show how many you have remaining unless you deselect and reselect whatever
      you were placing\r\nIt appears you can hold items beyond the allotted inventory
      space, as i had a full inventory and was able to pick up gold, and use it to
      place a sanctum while having an apparently full inventory.\r\n\r\n\uBB34\uBA54\uC774\uC758
